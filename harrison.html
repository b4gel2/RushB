    <h1>Harrison's Profile</h1>
    
    <p>My results from my 3 tests show that I am a very down to earth emotional person, who is very kind and trustworthy.  When I need to show leadership I have the ability to take control and lead a group but also have the foresight to know when to listen and take advice from others.  I’m a visual learner and can learn quickly on the job especially when being shown how to do something rather then being told.  I think my ideals on leadership is important as when working in a team sometimes someone is required to take the lead which I am more than capable of doing but to do so in a fair and respective manner.  It also shows that I need to surround myself with people who can help me better myself in group scenarios by being kind and showing me right from wrong in areas they have more expertise in, as well as people who aren’t afraid to disagree with me and work together to find the perfect solution.  I think these skills are vital to working great within a team environment because at any given time I can take the lead and push the team into a successful avenue but also gives me the foresight to know when to let someone else take charge and also when an idea I suggest might not be beneficial for the entire team.  I work best in team environments where ideas are bounced off each other and can be taught about the technical IT side of ideas I throw out there.</p>
    
    <p>My Ideal job was to be a homicide detective for Victoria Police, which is vastly different to everyone else in the group.  Everyone in the group besides me has dreams of working in game development or software development.  I personally think that their ideal jobs is perfect for this group assignment as it gives the rest of the group an environment to work on something that is in their field and they can gain skills for their future employment.  For me, however it is a little different as IT skills are not fundamental to my future job or dream.  Despite this, I think what I gain from this experience is learning how to work in a group/ work with people where I am the least educated on the topic and learning how to work outside of my comfort zone.  I think what I bring to this team is experience and ideas that come from outside the IT world.  In this instance I am sort of an outsider looking in and can provide insight and knowledge they may not have thought of due to my position.  I think I also bring in a different style of leadership they may not be used to that will help out the assignment process. </p>
