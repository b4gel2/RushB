    <title>IT Technologies - Rush B</title>
    <h1>IT Technologies</h1>
    
    <p>The IT world is constantly evolving, and at an exponentially growing rate. The myriad of inventive and innovative technologies that make up the IT industry have been through many iterations to become what they are today. At the currents stages, some have proven to be remarkable and revolutionary, while others are seen as nothing more than expreimental novelties and gimmicks that have a dim future. We have selected a few very notable technologies within the IT world that we believe have made a tremendous inpact on our society, both socially and economically.</p>

        <p><i>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</i></p>
        <p>Cloud is a service that allows the users to do computing things like servers, storage and other services over the internet, without using the physical hardware. Nowadays, cloud is used in many industries. Some of the popular cloud services are AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft Azure.Server is a hardware or software that provides services to the client. There are a lot of services provided by the server. Storage is one of the examples of the services.For this example, I’m going to use Microsoft Azure. Microsoft azure is a cloud computing platform built by Microsoft. It has many features like virtual machines, storages. For virtual machines, we can choose between Windows or Linux Virtual machines. The free version allows to use 750 hours of the virtual machines. Virtual machine allows the users to run an Operating System inside an Operating System. Some of the Virtual machine uses are new Operating System. The newer operating system may not be as good as the old one, so rather than risking the data loss, it’s better to try it on a VM. Virtual Machines also used to run outdated applications that may not support the newer Operating System. I Virtual Machines also allows to run multiple servers, Creating domain network, etc. The storage services also has multiple services, like Managed disks, Blob storage, and File storage. For the free version, the managed disks allows 64GB x 2, and for Blob Storage and File Storage, allows 5GB each.Microsoft Azure also has Database services, like Microsoft SQL and Azure Cosmos. For MS SQL, it has 250GB storage for free version, while Azure Cosmos only 5GB free version. The database is stored in the cloud, and the users can extend the size of the database, by paying more per gigabyte of data. Microsoft Azure also supports back-end for Mobile Applications and Web Applications. Developer tools like Visual Studio and SDKs also available. We don’t need to download them in our device, just access through the Azure Portal. In the future, there will be a lot of improvement for the cloud technology. In the next 3 or 5 years, the cloud will be used in every aspect in the world. With cloud servers, we won’t spend much money to implement something new, because we don’t need to buy any new hardware, or software. The subscription allows us to access many services and features. In the future, small companies may not buy a big server to get those features, but just subscribing to a cloud service depending on the needs. The users may get those features using a normal mid spec computer, and could be accessed anywhere, anytime. Those companies can do more with the small amount of budget.Other developments could be cloud services for mobile application. Nowadays, we use our phones all the time, bring it everywhere we go. We might bring our laptops in some times, but we always bring our phone anywhere. In the next few years, some cloud services may be available for mobile devices or tablets. It may be not as good as in computers, but it could save a lot of time and more efficient to do anything with the phone. Today phones has a great specification that allows us to do heavy tasks, or playing a good graphic games. It would be more useful if we could use our phones rather only for fun, but to get work done more easily and efficiently. Virtual machines access on mobile phones may look weird, but some mobile phones has similar operating system like tablets. Enabling those features in Android or iOS may look good on their range of tablets. Accessing those development tools by using mobile phones or tablet is a good improvement since there is no need a big screen to do, just type using on screen keyboard and we can get it all done by quick.</p>  
        <p><i>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</i></p>
        <p>With this Cloud technologies, it saves a lot of time and space. Google Drive provides cloud services that provides the data sharing between other users in the cloud. We don’t need to be connected into internal domain or workgroup to share files with each other. It also set permissions to users that is allowed to access so it also has a better security because it requires authentication and authorisation from a specific user. It is also make group works more efficient since it allows the users to access a file together and do it at that time. And other technologies from Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, it allows to use more features like virtual machines. Virtual machines can be created without using the host operating system storage, so it will remain for other uses. There also some development tools that can be accessed, so it reduces cost for buying a new software. The virtual machines could be used also for testing, so no need to buy another device for testing.</p>
        <p>There may be a newer jobs available for the cloud services. But for the hardware specialist and technician may be replaced by this cloud specialist. Actually wouldn’t be removed all since we still use a hardware, even if it is cheaper because we just use a normal computer to do a lot of things. The cloud specialist should be responsible for the cloud services to keep it running. There will be other job available depends on what are their job desk. The old jobs and technologies may be replaced, but it will come more newer. Old servers may not be used again, but there will be a new cheaper computer that can run a lot of cloud services with a small amount of budget. It also reduces the cost of electricity since it does not use a lot of electricity, but it will need a fast internet service to access those features.</p>
        <p><i>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</i></p>
        <p>The cloud server is used in anywhere in the world. Technologies always developing and there will always be something new in IT. One of the most used by people is cloud storage, like Google Drive. It really helps me for saving the data in the cloud and sharing with others. It also helps to do the group assignment, with Google Docs in Google Drive, I can do the Assignment together in one file, group chat for discussions, and adding comments. Some software are also uploaded to Google Drive to be easily downloaded.</p>
        <p>RMIT University also provides a cloud service using Citrix by accessing a service called myDesktop. RMIT myDesktop can be accessed through the browser or installing the Citrix Receiver in the device. It allows us to use the apps from the cloud without downloading or installing in your own device. It also has the feature to access the desktop called RMIT Desktop. All the files saved from the application can be saved to our device or stored in RMIT internal drive, but it only holds about 5 gigabytes. I also could do an assignment by using myDesktop service, for example Eclipse. By doing the programming assignment in myDesktop, when it comes to demonstration, I don’t need to bring my laptop and just access my assignment from myDesktop and run it in any device.</p>
        <p>Another example of cloud computing is Netflix. Netflix uses the Amazon Web Services to store those movies in the cloud. It saves a lot of time than buying a bunch of movies DVDs, and if we want to watch some series while we are not available when it first aired. So we can access those movies without buying DVDs and just subscribing by paying each month, we can access a wide range of movies and TV series that we like. My family subscribes the Netflix family subscription, so I also could create an account for Netflix and access it anywhere.</p><br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Autonomous Vehicles</i></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p><i>What does it do? </i></p>
        <p>Autonomous Vehicles are looking to become the way of the future; with cars having self-driving functions that look only to improve the way we live our lives.  To put it simply an autonomous vehicle is one that can get you from point A to point B with little to no human input.  As technology advances autonomous vehicles are becoming more and more realistic, especially with a lot of new cars these days having strong autonomous features, mainly being pushed by brands like Tesla.    The main driving force behind autonomous vehicles and where all the growth is occurring is in the car industry.  Car brands like Tesla have been working on making cars autonomous from their inception.  All current Tesla have the feature called lane departure avoidance where once set in a driving lane the car senses where the lane strips are and will keep the car central in the lane.  It also has an autopilot mode where drivers can sit back and take their hands off the wheel using this technology to ensure the car stays within the lane and basically drives it until the driver needs to take control in moving lanes or slowing down.   Google is also making grounds in the area with their own fully functioning self-driving car called WAYMO.  What started as a Google project of having a car using live Google maps street view to guide itself around the campus is now its own self-driving company.  To put it simply WAYMO is a self-driving Uber service only located in Phoenix, Arizona, where guests can book a WAYMO via the ride-sharing app.  It works exactly the same as Uber or a Taxi just with the difference that there is no one in the drivers seat.  The state of the art technology is still being worked out but basically it is possible in current days for a car to drive from point A to point B in traffic without assistance or a driver, however it has not been introduced so heavily to the market as there still is the risk of accidents with there being a few deaths recorded due to self driving features, such as tesla autopilot.  The future for autonomous vehicles, however, is really exciting with the technology only improving.   Within the next 3 years the possibilities are endless, with there to only be more and more self driving cars on the roads each day.  Uber is investing a lot of money into self-driving technology with the hopes of one day removing drivers from there all there cars and being run purely off self driving technology.   Within the last 24 hours Uber has actually begun to start mapping out the streets of the city of Dallas as it begins to slowly roll out its self-driving car features within the city for a test demo.  If successful in Dallas, Uber plan on mapping a whole range of cities before rolling out self-driving cars worldwide.  The science behind self-driving cars is very impressive and is a step up from the basics we’ve had in cars for years, such as with assistive parking and the automatic self brake system.  It is these basics along with new innovations such as blind spot monitoring and forward collision warnings that create the basics for self-driving.  With new cars having sensors to sense all these it is easy to understand how a car could operate without a driver, all the new technology is just to ensure safety on the roads by creating technology that follows the rules of the roads and can operate through tough conditions like turning in heavy traffic e.c.t.  The growth in these sensors mixed with the mapping systems used in Google maps that assist-creating routes for the cars to follow is the modern technology propelling this futuristic idea to fruition.</p>
        <p><i>What is the likely impact? </i></p>
        <p>The impact of this technology development is huge for the companies and the potential safety of people using the product however there is a lot of downside to employment when self-driving cars are introduced as a legitimate business model.  If companies such as Uber are successful in implementing self-driving technology it will result in the loss of thousands of jobs displacing lots of people who live off being drivers.  This will only further expand with other driving industries, such as taxi drivers also becoming redundant, as a driver is no longer required.  The introduction of this technology has a lot of pros and cons, the big pros being that studies have found that 94% of car accidents are due to human area, meaning that if autonomous vehicles are rolled out worldwide you are potentially removing 94% of car accidents and saving thousands of human lives, however in doing so you are removing 100% of driving related jobs and replacing them with a robotic system.  These changes will also severely affect the car industry with companies that produce cars having to change to reflect societies standards.  These changes can already be seen today with companies moving from petrol cars to electric cars in a move to help the environment however if self driving car technology improves rapidly and is in high demand, car companies will have to also change rapidly to conform to the norms of the new society or risk going under for not changing with the times.  I think, however, that the only major market that is affected by this technology are human employed drivers as their job becomes irrelevant and redundant when this technology takes off.  Car brands are a little safer however due to the fact that there is a market for people who still like to drive and want to buy cars they can drive themselves.</p>
        <p><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
        <p>To be completely honest this will not affect me or my family or my friends a great deal.  The potential for the roads to be statistically a lot safer will obviously affect everyone hugely but I would only ever use the technology when I am going out for a night on the town or where driving is not an option.  As much as I’d love a vehicle that gets me from point A to point B without having to do any work I do enjoy rolling the window down on a nice sunny day and going for a drive and nothing will ever change that.  There is always something nice about sitting behind the wheel of a car and driving that will always beat just sitting there letting a robot do all the work.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Robots</i></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p><i>What does it do? </i></p>
        <p>There are hundreds of companies around the globe that are designing robots that aid patients with rehabilitation from injuries and strokes. The most advanced robotic devices aid patients with their ability to walk, robots such as Cyberdyne’s HAL robot, HAL is able to read signals from the brain and apply precise assistance to the areas of the body that are not responding to those signals. HAL is able to help with leg and arm movements. In the future similar devices will become available that are capable of assisting with even more severe rehabilitation cases, the future of this technology will resemble full exoskeleton suits that are able to monitor most muscles groups and provide full movement assistance to rehabilitation patience. The developments that make this technology possible is called bio electric signal (BES) readers, as we learn more about how the communicates with muscle groups we will be able to develop more advanced and accurate assistance mechanisms.</p>
        <p><i>Da Vinci</i> is a robot specialised for use in the field of surgery. It is a system of arms equipped with tools such as cameras and other medical instruments. Da Vinci is piloted by the surgeon through a control console in the surgery room, the console allows the surgeon to see camera feeds from the robot while remotely controlling da Vinci’s four arms. Da Vinci is one of the most advanced robots in its field it has the ability to perform complex surgical tasks from organ transplants to cancer treatment. Da Vinci is currently limited by its control systems and the surgeon using them, in the future surgical robots will focus on becoming more precise and will incorporate machine learning AI to become more adaptable in assisting the surgeon, surgical robots will also branch out into more specialisations for example advances are being made in the field of spine surgery. Soon there will be a robot for every type of surgery specialised and capable of facilitating the surgeons needs perfectly. Years from now artificial intelligence and mechanical precision will become so advanced there maybe one robot that can complete any surgical task without human control but for now surgical robots are merely assisting tools to the surgeon. </p>
        <p><i>What is the likely impact? </i></p>
        <p>The advancement of rehabilitation robots will allow for quicker and easier recoveries for people who have had injuries or strokes, the development in brain signal reading technologies will help sith the advancement of similar rehabilitation devices but will also aid other scientific areas with understanding brain functions and the damage caused by strokes. Stroke victims and amputees will be most affected by this technological advancement because they will be able to receive more advanced solutions to recover from their conditions. This technology will not make other jobs or technology redundant instead it will expand the work opportunities and tools used in the field of rehabilitation, perhaps creating specialised work positions for robotic rehabilitation.</p>
        <p><i>Da Vinci</i> and other future iterations will revolutionise the field of surgery by changing the role of the surgeon and expanding the capabilities of surgical procedures. The advancement of surgical robots will expand the possibilities of surgery by making human hands redundant and exposing new methods and techniques that will increase the safety and success rate of surgery. All patients that require any form of surgery will be affected by the benefits that this technology provides, eventually every type of surgery from simple to complex will benefit from robotics. Surgical robots such as da Vinci may make the traditional surgeons redundant as new training and procedures are implemented that changes the role that the surgeon plays in the surgery theatre, new knowledge and skill set will be required to master the new tools at their disposal. A surgeons assistants maybe adapted to more of a technician role to ensure the machine is running as intended and less people may be required overall to perform a successful surgery.</p>
        <p><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
        <p>Unless I become ill or injured these technologies may never directly affect me but in the future rehabilitation exoskeletons may adapt to becoming mobility assistance for the elderly and other implants maybe developed using brain signal reading technology that can improve motor functions and hand eye coordination. The medical field will incorporate many different uses for robots that will improve public health, reduce the risk of terminal conditions and extend life expectancy. Family and friends will be aided by these advancements similarly to myself.</p><br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i>Cybersecurity</i></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p><i>What does it do? </i></p>
        <p>One of the most state-of-the-art implementations of cyber security is The CyberArk Digital Vault created by a team of security engineers from CyberArk, a world leading cyber security agency designed with several security features and configurations that help to minimize the attack surface of individual host servers. Hence, account information will be securely stored. The Digital Vault technology engulfs data with eight layers of security within a present network framework, forming a repository to withhold confidential data which acts a digital safe. A safe may hold many files however all files are encrypted with a unique file encryption key and a different safe encryption key which is inimitable to the safe. The vault stores all the safe encryption keys and the keys are encrypted with an individual vault encryption key. Individuals only have access to the keys based on whether the individual has the appropriate access rights. Access to the safe is classified by administrators who work at CyberArk and data within the safe may only be accessed under supervision from a Safe Supervisor. CyberArk’s Digital Vault is continually being updated and upgraded with the latest technologies and hardware to prevail upon other cybersecurity companies to gain the most satisfied customers with their product. </p>
        <p>There are cybersecurity measures which can be sought by individuals at a reasonable cost which have great efficiency and effectiveness such as VPN’s. A VPN allows the user's initial IP address to be replaced with one from the Virtual Private Network provider, this lets users to have information such as their location hidden or misleading. Furthermore, VPN’s also encrypts data sent between the Network of the user and the VPN server. VPN’s have also been used to illegally download movies, games and tv shows by individuals using torrents. Furthermore, as mentioned before VPN’s can allow your computer to seem as though it is in another location making certain websites which are blocked in the computers original location blocked due to certain legalities, however, now the user can connect to a VPN server in a country where there is no legislation to block or remove websites which provide torrents.</p>
        <p>As AI systems and learning systems are fed with data regarding security threats, these systems then make decisions to prevent cyber threats depending on the situation and environment. This process is called Deep Learning and as more data is created and transferred these AI systems can continually grow and become more intelligent to prevent cyber threats from causing damage. Machine learning is the overarching process where deep learning uses a hierarchical level of artificial neural networks to undergo the procedure of machine learning. Like brains the artificial neural networks are built with neuron nodes connected in a web like arrangement. This allows deep learning systems to process data with a non-linear approach which is far more complex than sourcing data through a linear approach which most programs do. Soon, Individuals will not have to monitor cyber threats as AI systems will be able to resolve most, if not all threats with precision and ease. New and more powerful computer components such as the latest CPU’s and mass hard drive and RAM storages will allow AI systems to have power and speed over any computer which is evidently seen as a threat. This is significantly advantageous as companies will rely less on the performance of the computer and focus more on the complexity of algorithms within in the machine learning programs. In addition, due to the abundance of data at arm’s reach of company’s machine learning and deep learning will be accustom to many more companies in the world, making data more valuable than seen in the past.</p>
        <p><i>What is the likely impact? </i></p>
        <p>As AI systems are becoming more powerful due to increased complexity of algorithms and widespread sourcing and use of data, cybersecurity jobs will be at risk as AI systems will take over due to their accuracy and precision when dealing with hackers and other malicious cyber security threats. This will leave many individuals that are in the line of work of cybersecurity jobless, which can impact the livelihood of families across the globe. The growth of technology and data can be deemed as advantageous when observing the positive outcomes towards cybersecurity, as large companies will spend less on cybersecurity engineers to counter security threats. However, companies will begin a war on data, where everyone can be affected positively, and negatively as new legislation will need to be implemented to alleviate the risk of personal data being compromised. </p>
        <p><i>How will this affect you? </i></p>
        <p>This may affect me in my daily life as I will need to be more conscious when giving my personal information away to companies and signing up for certain benefits, because in the end my personal data may get in the wrong hands. Therefore, reading the terms and conditions will become a more prominent task which is done by me and many others instead of now days just skimming to the bottom and accepting the fine details to which I and many others do daily. As machine learning and deep learning are slowly but surely making breakthroughs in the world of Artificial Intelligence, I believe this concept will be brought to members of my family and friends’ attention, where they will have to understand the fundamentals of this growing process which will inevitably control decisions and choices we make and ultimately the way we all live our lives. </p>
