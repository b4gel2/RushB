    <h1>IT Work - Interviewing an IT Professional</h1>
    
    <p>Our assignment required us to learn more about the real-world application of IT skills in the work force. To do this, we have interviewed a network engineer for Metro Trains who was more than happy to provide us with information pertaining to his duties, how he approaches them, and as well as his personal thoughts of the future of the IT industry as a whole.</p>
