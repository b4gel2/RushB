    <h1>ASSIGNMENT 2: THE IT WORLD</h1>
    
    <h2>About Our Group</h2>
    
    <p>We are a bunch of guys who have a shared interest in IT, but you probably knew that much already. This group was formed by way of proximity and process of elimination. By that, we mean that we just met up with whoever was closest to each other, and then some. Each of us are different, with varying sets of skills and other interests that makes our group a mixed bag, but we believe that such diveresity will grant us flexibility and provide more perspectives throughout our journey. In any case, we hope to give it our best effort for our project and are excited to use this opportunity to not only show not only who we are, but what we are capable of.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>My name is Brian Tagle, student number s3717045. I was born on September 10, 1999 in the United States and moved to Australia in 2013. My parents are from the Philippines but I am a first-generation American. I graduated VCE in 2017 and am studying a Bachelor of IT here at RMIT.</p>
        <p>My main hobbies include playing videogames, playing music (guitar, bass, etc.), watching TV and film, and reading and learning about technology. I favor Maths and Science, but I have also done well in English, History, and experimented with the Arts during my time in school. My interest in IT goes way back to being a child. I was always interested in technology, from the game consoles I played to the family computer. As I moved through my school years, I began to connect my hobbies with technology as a whole. It became clear that I needed to pursue IT if I were to do at least one of the things I enjoyed, and get paid to do it.</p><p>With that in mind, my experience with IT is balanced between different subfields but not focused on one. I hope to expand and refine my skills and knowledge throughout my time at RMIT. I have been working at Target for a little while, but I aspire to seek a career in the IT or Computer Sciences fields, whether it's Game Development, Audio Engineering, or Data Analytics.</p>

        <p>My name is Nicolas Papageorgiou (s3791683), I was born in Melbourne, Australia, however I have Greek heritage. My hobbies include gaming, playing sports such as soccer and footy and watching movies and tv shows. Ever since the first time I laid my hands on a keyboard and mouse I knew I wanted to learn more about computers. Later, from that moment I managed to select and construct computer parts to build my very own pc which at the time was primarily for gaming. This helped me explore the world of computers and understand their full capability which lead me into my interest in programming. I chose to embark on my IT career at RMIT as I know my full capabilities will be reached through the many course majors which can be completed to have a fulfilling, enjoyable job. At RMIT I expect to learn the expectations required of me in an actual IT job, depending on what IT related job I choose to pursue. I am a member of team Rush B, which is related to the game CSGO which I play on the odd occasion.</p>

        <p>My name is Naufal Audrian Raihan. My student number is s3698114. I’m studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. My hobbies are Playing computer games and Playing music. I’ve been interested in IT since a little. Always like to troubleshoot PCs and playing with Operating Systems like trying on a virtual machine. </p>
        
        <p>I’m interested in Cyber Security jobs. Like Cyber Security analyst. However, I'm also interested in system Administrator and networking stuff. I'm going to create a project called "Search by Music". It's a search engine, but to find a specific music. It will recognize the audio that being recorded and will find the music that match from the recording. It's almost similar with Search by Voice by Google, but it's more specific only for finding specific music that we heard but we don't know the song title. The program will be a web based program that requires a browser to access. It will be available in the desktop, tablets, and mobile. By playing a few notes or some lyrics, the program will detect the song and try to get the information of it.</p>

        <p>Harrison - I was born on the 1st of March 1997 and have the stress of having to share and compete against Justin Bieber for the best person born on the 1st of March.  My Mum was a migrant from Rome, Italy and my Dad was grew up on an orchid in cold stream and knows his way around a market.  I finished VCE in 2015 and can speak Italian due to my family heritage.  I have worked at Village Cinemas for 7 years now slowly working up the ranks and hierarchy, which only helps my favor and passion for movies.  My absolute passion would be supporting AS Roma in the Italian soccer league as well as supporting the mighty Brisbane lions, which, as I write this, sit top of the AFL ladder for the first time since 1913.  I am currently in my 4th year of university, 3rd at RMIT after studying at Monash University and Ryerson University in Toronto for a year.  I have zero IT experience besides knowing how to operate the basics of a computer and setting up Wi-Fi. </p>
