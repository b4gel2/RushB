    <h1>Our Project Ideas</h1>
    
    <p>Initially, it as very hard to decide on a single idea for our project. Bcause each of our own ideas were so vastly diffrerent from each other, making a compromise or mixing them together would have just resulted in an overcomplicated mess. So we agreed against doing so. After further discussion, we ended up focusing on one idea that seemed the most interesting to bring into fruition. With a single goal now in sight, we are excited to share our proposal in hopes of it becoming a reality in the future.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>A VR application that aims to provide a first-person perspective of the interior and exterior of a house in order to allow potential buyers to view the house in all its usual detail through a virtual reality headset. This technology will make the act of purchasing a new property much easier by allowing the buyers to immediately answer any questions they may have had about the property. The application will require full 3d scans to be made of all or some rooms in the house this will allow users to then explore that space from their own home as if they were there. The app will cover multiple property types from houses to apartments and will also include features for viewing properties still under construction. The user will be able to traverse the virtual property through virtual walking and teleportation, to navigate the property an interactive floorplan will be viewable on the HUD and will allow for ease of movement between rooms.</p>
    
    <h2>How The Project will be useful</h2>
    <p>The application will be useful for both real-estate companies and customers. Customers will be able to identify whether rooms are the correct size whether the houses layout will suit their needs and other details about both the interior and exterior. The app will make the buyers life easier by allowing them to view multiple houses in one day and be able to narrow down their preferred property quickly and efficiently. The real-estate companies will benefit from the app by being able to provide superior advertising and more detailed and insightful information about the properties. </p>
    
    <h2>Features and Hardware</h2>
    <p>The app should be able to run on all a wide range of VR products including lower end models such as the Google Daydream or the Samsung Gear VR, with this capability the app will be widely accessible only requiring a modern smartphone to operate. The capabilities of the app will depend slightly on the technology it is running on, on higher end VR headsets such as Oculus and HTC products the user will have access to new features incorporating the handheld controllers. I envision the ability for customers to view a room and manage its look to suit their liking in the virtual world, they will have access to wallpaper, curtains, furniture management and other smaller details that would allow them to construct their own custom vision for the house before they purchase it. This customisation feature will be enhanced by the ability to view catalogues from popular furniture brands and use them in the virtual world. Cooperation will need to be required between the furniture brands and ourselves in order to bring this feature to the customer. The customer will be able to view an empty version of any room that displays the basic dimensions of the room, from this point the customer will have the ability to add elements such as furniture to it as they wish all within the virtual world. All room scans will be detailed taking into account irregular room shapes and integrated features such as a fireplace or marble tabletop. With the combination of the furniture and decoration features the users will have the option to insert real life furniture from their favourite stores as a scale model in order to create a more detailed picture of what their ideal home would look like. This feature will incorporate great amount of detail into the experience allowing the user to change the colour and material of objects with the goal of creating the most immersive experience possible. Ultimately the app aims to remove the need to visit a house in person and create an equally immersive and insightful experience that becomes more productive and helpful with the addition of interactivity with the virtual world. The app could be developed using the Unity engine and 3D camera scan technology. In conclusion the app will have a low barrier of entry only requiring a lower end VR headset, it will provide an array of uses ranging from learning more in depth details about a property to personalising a potential home by interacting with a virtual space. The function of the app is comparatively simple and could use many other existing apps as inspiration, despite its apparent simplicity the app will introduce a new level of marketing for businesses and a new level of ease of use for customers in the niche real estate industry</p>
    
    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>I would need to become much more familiar with programming languages and various app building softwareâ€™s. I would need skills specifically in developing VR products in order to achieve the fundamental aspect of the product. I would require a device to test prototypes in VR and knowledge and experience of what is expected for a satisfactory user experience in a VR application, for this I will need to research the history and development of VR and gain experience using VR equipment first hand in order to understand what a VR app requires. </p>
    
    <h2>Project Impact</h2>
    <p>If the application is developed and includes the features listed then hopefully it will become a common addition to the process of finding a new home, many real estate companies may incorporate the app into their existing systems, hopefully it acts as an improvement over the existing systems and is incorporated in order to bridge the gap between the customers and the property allowing them to gain a greater understanding of the properties they view inevitably making their search and choice a little more simple. The app should introduce a new level of planning for the customer allowing them to visualise every aspect of their new home before they make a purchase.</p>
