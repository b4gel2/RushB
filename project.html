    <h1>Our Project Ideas</h1>
    
    <p>Initially, it as very hard to decide on a single idea for our project. Bcause each of our own ideas were so vastly diffrerent from each other, making a compromise or mixing them together would have just resulted in an overcomplicated mess. So we agreed against doing so. After further discussion, we ended up focusing on one idea that seemed the most interesting to bring into fruition. With a single goal now in sight, we are excited to share our proposal in hopes of it becoming a reality in the future.</p>
