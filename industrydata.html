    <h1>Industry Data</h1>
    <p>We have conducted research on the data provided by <i>Burning Glass</i> as well as some additional sources in order to give an overview of today's job market from the perspective of each of our preferred jobs.</p>
    
    <p>Ideal jobs for this group include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game development</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Cyber-security</li>
        <li>Web development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From the groupâ€™s ideal jobs, the highest demand from employers is for software developers, followed by web developers, while demand for game development and cyber-security is not available in the current list of demand.</p>
    <p>IT specific skills:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graphic design</li>
        <li>Website production</li>
        <li>Coding languages</li>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SQL and JavaScript are currently the most in-demand skills required by employers, followed closely by Microsoft Windows. Ahead of that, graphic design and website production rank as the next two most-demanded skills by employers.</p>
    <p>General skills:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Planning</li>
        <li>Communication Skills</li>
        <li>Team Work</li>
        <li>Meeting Deadlines</li>
        <li>Detail-orientated Skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Communication skills are seen as the most important general skill by employers, clearly standing out as the number one skill in demand. Team work is the next most-demanded skill, followed in order by planning, detail-orientated skills, creativity and meeting deadlines.</p>
    <p>The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in the required skill set are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JAVA</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>SAP</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The three highest ranked general skills which are not in the required skill set are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem solving</li>
        <li>Organisational skills</li>
        <li>Writing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After assessing the data, my opinion of an ideal job has not changed, as most of the required skills still have relatively high demand from employers, despite some of them not being ranked higher than others.</p>
