    <h1>IT Work - Interviewing an IT Professional</h1>
    
    <p>Our assignment required us to learn more about the real-world application of IT skills in the work force. To do this, we have interviewed a network engineer for Metro Trains who was more than happy to provide us with information pertaining to his duties, how he approaches them, and as well as his personal thoughts of the future of the IT industry as a whole.</p>
    
    <h2>Mark Escaner</h2>
    <h3>Network Engineer for Metro Trains</h3>
    
    <h4><i>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</i></h4>
    
    <p>As a networking engineer, Mark is responsible for connecting the train stations in the area to each other, and then connecting them to servers housed within local data centres. He generally handles the “business side” of Metro Trains and is responsible for helping to set up, manage and maintain several technical components of their infrastructure. These include, but are not limited to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internet</li>
        <li>Emails</li>
        <li>Applications</li>
        <li>Mobile phones and other communications accessories</li>
    </ul>
    <p>His position is vital to Metro Trains as the necessity of connectivity becomes more and more apparent in public transport today. Information such as the current position and status of each train must always be known to all stations and data centres to ensure the safety and integrity of the passengers and trains respectively.</p>
    
    <h4><i>What kinds of people does the IT Professional interact with? Are the other IT Professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</i></h4>
    <p>As far as other IT professionals go, Mark interacts with multiple different business units as part of his job. He meets with an applications team to keep them up to date with the network. He also shares information with database analysts regarding the networking between stations and the data centres. Lastly, he mentioned speaking with exchanges and mails teams in order to optimize communications.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Mark meets with third-party contractors such as cablers and electricians to set up the networking infrastructure for the requested station. They are also present if there are problems within an existing network that needs to be diagnosed and resolved.</p>
    
    <h4><i>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</i></h4>
    <p>A large portion of Mark’s time at work—roughly eighty percent according to him—is spent at his desk in the office. This is primarily because a lot of his duties can be done remotely from his computer. The remainder of his time is spent outside the office, completing tasks such as troubleshooting internal problems and surveying areas such as train stations.</p>
    
    <h4><i>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</i></h4>
    <p>A major challenge of being an IT in general, according to Mark, is being required to solve problems. As he is given tasks by his superiors, he is left to his own skills and tools on how to approach them. As IT is both very open-ended and open-minded, it can initially be overwhelming about the different possibilities of achieving a certain goal. Nonetheless, Mark finds the challenge exciting as he has more creative freedom to how he can fix issues.</p>
    <p><i>“As long as it gets done, they don’t care how I do it.”</i></p>
    <p>Another known challenge for Mark is being regularly introduced to new technologies. This is noticeable to people who access Metro Trains daily, with new implementations such as the new Touch-On and Top-Up machines. Additionally, tech such as mobile phones are becoming more necessary to the integrity of Metro Trains’ networks. These factors, and more, encourage Mark to be ready to be caught up with the ever-evolving technology, and require him to be adaptive and resourceful in any scenario.</p>
    
    <h4>Extra Details</h4>
    <p>Mark and I discussed the appeal of becoming a network engineer as well as his opinions and insights on the future of IT’s job market.</p>
    <p>One thing that inclined him to pursue network engineering is that it “enables connectivity”. We discussed the rapidly growing necessity of a strongly connected world, while also pointing out the foreseeable downsides such as lack of privacy, lack of security, and increased vulnerability of those who are not connected.</p>
    <p>As mentioned before, the challenges brought forth to IT professionals such as Mark such as evolving technologies and open-ended thinking are exciting, as he explained why he “enjoys playing with tech and problem-solving”. To him, they are a motivation to do his best and be more creative when completing tasks.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we talked about the future of IT, and the growing positive outlook on its increasing market. </p>
    <p><i>“As technology becomes more complex, and as we become more connected with each other, there are going to be new issues and faults within out systems. With these new problems, there will be new approaches on how things can be done.”</i></p>
    <p>State-of-the-art technologies, such as cloud services and modern robotics are examples of ways Metro Trains are trying to evolve with the society built around it.</p><br>
    
    <p>Mark closed his insights with a single empowering statement:</p>
    <h4><i>“All companies have a network.”</i></h4><br>
